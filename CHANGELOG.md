# Change log

This file keeps track of the changes to the web extension

## 1.2

Bug fixes and improv... nope, there are actually two new features:

- Automatic icon detection, BrowserNow will use your mac's existing icon in the menu bar, even if you have manually changed the icon in "Get Info".
- Added keyboard shortcuts so you can use `âŒ˜1-9` to select browsers (they're in alphabetical order for consistency).

Other bits:

- Because native icons are being used, the app got ever so slightly smaller, because the previous icons were embedded in there.
- Use `âŒ˜Q` to quick quit BrowserNow.
- The menu is a bit bigger (the icons that macOS provides are bigger and I kinda liked the look).

## 1.1

The menu now has icons. The supported browsers are
`Brave`, `Chrome`, `Edge`, `Firefox`, `Opera` and `Safari`.
Icons are provided by
