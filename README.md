## Ethos

I make apps that I use regularly and I like high-quality apps.
You can get this for free by downloading the release from GitHub,
or you can support development by buying the app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/browsernow/id1633886387?mt=12)
and you get automatic updates.

## Install

1. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/robb-j/BrowserNow/releases)
2. Download and unzip the app
3. Drag it into your Applications folder
4. Double click it to launch

## Release

1. Ensure git is clean
2. Make sure [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) is up to date
3. Update any documentation if needed
4. Bump the version and build in the xcode project
5. Commit those changes as `X.Y.Z`
6. Tag the commit as `vX.Y.Z`
7. **Product → Archive** then **Distribute app → Developer ID → Upload → ...**
8. Push the commit and tag to GitHub
9. Wait for the app to be notorized
10. Create a release from the tag, attach the notarised app and write the release notes
